# education-creator-solver
Creates and solves assessment problems in apportionment and graph theory for an online Math for General Education Course.

# Build Apportionment
Apportionment determines how to divide a fixed number of things among groups of different sizes (e.g. representative seats and populations). The function built in this code allows the user to choose the number of populations needing apportioned and the apportionment solving method. These solving methods include: Hamilton, Jefferson, and Huntington-Hill. A random 3-digit seed number is used to determine the number of seats and population sizes so that every problem created is unique.

# Build Graph Theory
The code specifically creates and solves problems involving graphs with Hamiltonian Circuits, meaning the path visits every vertex once with no repeats and the path begins and ends at the same vertex. The function built in this code allows the user to choose the maximum potential edge value and path solving method. A random 3-digit seed number is used to determine which edge weights to use and their location on the graph.
